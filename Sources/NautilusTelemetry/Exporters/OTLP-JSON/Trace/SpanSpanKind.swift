	/** SpanKind is the type of span. Can be used to specify additional relationships between spans in addition to a parent/child relationship.   - SPAN_KIND_UNSPECIFIED: Unspecified. Do NOT use as default. Implementations MAY assume SpanKind to be INTERNAL when receiving UNSPECIFIED.  - SPAN_KIND_INTERNAL: Indicates that the span represents an internal operation within an application, as opposed to an operation happening at the boundaries. Default value.  - SPAN_KIND_SERVER: Indicates that the span covers server-side handling of an RPC or other remote network request.  - SPAN_KIND_CLIENT: Indicates that the span describes a request to some remote service.  - SPAN_KIND_PRODUCER: Indicates that the span describes a producer sending a message to a broker. Unlike CLIENT and SERVER, there is often no direct critical path latency relationship between producer and consumer spans. A PRODUCER span ends when the message was accepted by the broker while the logical processing of the message might span a much longer time.  - SPAN_KIND_CONSUMER: Indicates that the span describes consumer receiving a message from a broker. Like the PRODUCER kind, there is often no direct critical path latency relationship between producer and consumer spans. */
