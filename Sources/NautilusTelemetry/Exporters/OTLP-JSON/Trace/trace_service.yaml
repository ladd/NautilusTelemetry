            Flags, a bit field.

            Bits 0-7 (8 least significant bits) are the trace flags as defined in W3C Trace
            Context specification. To read the 8-bit W3C trace flag, use
            `flags & SPAN_FLAGS_TRACE_FLAGS_MASK`.

            See https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context-2/#trace-flags for the flag definitions.

            Bits 8 and 9 represent the 3 states of whether the link is remote.
            The states are (unknown, is not remote, is remote).
            To read whether the value is known, use `(flags & SPAN_FLAGS_CONTEXT_HAS_IS_REMOTE_MASK) != 0`.
            To read whether the link is remote, use `(flags & SPAN_FLAGS_CONTEXT_IS_REMOTE_MASK) != 0`.

            Readers MUST NOT assume that bits 10-31 (22 most significant bits) will be zero.
            When creating new spans, bits 10-31 (most-significant 22-bits) MUST be zero.

    SpanSpanKind:
      type: string
      description: |-
        SpanKind is the type of span. Can be used to specify additional relationships between spans
        in addition to a parent/child relationship.

         - SPAN_KIND_UNSPECIFIED: Unspecified. Do NOT use as default.
        Implementations MAY assume SpanKind to be INTERNAL when receiving UNSPECIFIED.
         - SPAN_KIND_INTERNAL: Indicates that the span represents an internal operation within an application,
        as opposed to an operation happening at the boundaries. Default value.
         - SPAN_KIND_SERVER: Indicates that the span covers server-side handling of an RPC or other
        remote network request.
         - SPAN_KIND_CLIENT: Indicates that the span describes a request to some remote service.
         - SPAN_KIND_PRODUCER: Indicates that the span describes a producer sending a message to a broker.
        Unlike CLIENT and SERVER, there is often no direct critical path latency relationship
        between producer and consumer spans. A PRODUCER span ends when the message was accepted
        by the broker while the logical processing of the message might span a much longer time.
         - SPAN_KIND_CONSUMER: Indicates that the span describes consumer receiving a message from a broker.
        Like the PRODUCER kind, there is often no direct critical path latency relationship
        between producer and consumer spans.

            is the time when the server's application handler starts running.
            Value is UNIX Epoch time in nanoseconds since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970.

            This field is semantically required and it is expected that end_time >= start_time.
